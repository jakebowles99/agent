Akshansh clarified that the training should cover both communication and consulting basics.\n  - **Discovery Process Checkpoints**: Akshansh highlighted gaps in the discovery process, suggesting the implementation of a standard checkpoint after discovery to assess project readiness and identify areas for improvement before development begins, to avoid unexpected complexities.\n  - **Documentation and Templates**: Jake emphasised the need for proper documentation of discovery outputs, as these are paid activities and should reflect the value delivered. Nandan suggested sharing examples of good documentation, and Akshansh confirmed work on templates for apps and automate projects, while Jake and Charlie discussed the need for different approaches for data projects.\n  - **Team Capability and Delegation**: Jake questioned whether only Charlie and Akshansh could conduct discoveries, with Charlie confirming that, for now, only they (with some support from Nandan) could handle end-to-end discoveries. The team discussed the need to develop equivalent capabilities in India, mentioning Ajay as a potential candidate for apps and automate, and Gagan for the ABA function, pending resource availability.\n\n### Delivery Bottlenecks and Process Improvements\nAkshansh, Nandan, and Jake reviewed major delivery bottlenecks encountered in 2025 across data, AI, and apps, and discussed process changes implemented to address these, including improved documentation, code reviews, and project visibility.\n  - **Data Discovery and Documentation**: Nandan reported that long and short data discovery processes had been major hurdles but were now being addressed by himself and Jake. Improved documentation practices were also being implemented, though the team acknowledged ongoing challenges with documentation quality.\n  - **Database Projects and CI/CD**: Nandan explained that all databases are now governed via database projects, code repositories, and CI/CD pipelines, which has resolved many manual challenges and dependency issues seen in previous projects.\n  - **Resource Bandwidth and Delegation**: A key ongoing challenge is limited bandwidth, with only Nandan, Jake, and Hemanth working on data projects. Delegation of code reviews and project responsibilities is being trialled to address this, with junior team members like Yash and Hemanth taking on more review tasks.\n  - **Project Visibility and Reporting**: Akshansh identified a lack of project visibility, particularly regarding budget and progress, and implemented a temporary process requiring regular reporting of budget, burndown charts, and work completed. The team discussed the need for a central dashboard and the limitations caused by the absence of a timesheet app.\n  - **Code Review Cadence**: The team compared code review practices between data and apps projects, agreeing on the need for more frequent reviews in data projects (every few days or weekly), while apps projects would require less frequent reviews due to their development cycles. Delegation of reviews to senior team members was discussed as a way to manage workload.\n\n### Skill Gaps, Team Development, and Consulting Mindset\nJake, Charlie, Nandan, and Akshansh discussed skill gaps in the team, the need for more senior staff, and the importance of fostering a consulting mindset, with feedback provided on individual team members\u2019 performance and development needs.\n  - **Seniority and Autonomy**: Jake and Charlie noted a lack of seniority and autonomy in the team, with too many junior staff relying on senior members for answers. They agreed on the need to hire more experienced staff and to encourage a culture of independent problem-solving.\n  - **Consulting Mindset and Holistic Thinking**: Nandan and Akshansh observed that developers often focus narrowly on their tasks without considering data governance, downstream impacts, or the broader project context, leading to issues such as access control problems during migrations. The team agreed that developing a consulting mindset is essential.\n  - **Individual Performance Feedback**: The team reviewed the performance of Yash, noting improvements in SQL and code reviews but identifying a need for more holistic thinking and questioning of requirements. Feedback was also provided on other team members, with ongoing training and weekly check-ins to support development.\n  - **AI and Data Engineering Skills**: Jake highlighted that he is the only person able to handle certain AI and data engineering tasks, with Prathap able to use Co-pilot Studio but not yet ready for Foundry deployments. Plans to upskill team members and clarify responsibilities were discussed.\n\n### RACI Communication and Training\nAkshansh, Charlie, and Jake discussed the need for formal training on the RACI matrix, agreeing to record a session to ensure all staff understand their roles and responsibilities, with Charlie taking ownership of the action.\n  - **RACI Training Session**: Akshansh pointed out that many staff do not understand the RACI matrix, despite it being shared. Charlie agreed to record a training session, making it optional, and requested final approval of job descriptions from Jake and Nandan before distribution.\n\n### 2026 Delivery Goals and KPI Alignment\nCharlie assigned the team the task of drafting SMART, measurable goals for 2026 delivery, with Jake, Nandan, and Akshansh to collaborate and reconvene next week to finalise objectives and align KPIs.\n  - **Goal Setting Action**: Charlie requested that Jake and Nandan propose 2-3 SMART, measurable objectives for data, while Akshansh and Charlie would do the same for apps and automate, with the aim of aligning individual KPIs to these goals.\n\n### Internal Tooling and Development Environment\nJake demonstrated the new internal development landing zone, built to provide secure, self-service cloud development environments for the team, and outlined plans for further enhancements and self-hosting capabilities.\n  - **Development Landing Zone Features**: Jake described the deployment of a secure, enterprise-ready internal development environment using Kubernetes and Azure, allowing team members to spin up ephemeral workspaces with full admin rights, supporting both apps and automate and data projects.\n  - **Self-Hosting and Expansion Plans**: Jake explained that the environment is hosted in the ISV subscription and will be expanded to support additional tools like Foundry, with plans to self-host and manage certificates independently from Fraser\u2019s team.\n\n### Project Updates and New Team Members\nThe team discussed the onboarding of Rahul to the product team, his assignment to the LCP data extraction project, and the circumstances of his early start, with Nandan and Charlie clarifying the situation.\n  - **Rahul\u2019s Onboarding and Assignment**: Nandan explained that Rahul was integrated into the team earlier than expected at Andy\u2019s request and is currently working with HI on the LCP data extraction project, with Navsheen coordinating the onboarding process.\n\n### Organisational Structure and Job Descriptions Update\nCharlie, Akshansh, Jake, and Nandan discussed the need to update the organisational structure, assign roles, and create job descriptions, with Charlie taking responsibility for initiating updates and coordinating with Andy and Fraser.\n  -
