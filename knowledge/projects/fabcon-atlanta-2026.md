## Status Update (Feb 6, 2026)

**Decision**: Likely skipping Atlanta March 2026 due to time constraints.

> "So turns out I can only move Fabcon to next year also in Atlanta. I am leaning towards that still because just do not have time" - Jake Bowles

### Transfer Attempt - BLOCKED
Attempted to transfer registration to European event (Barcelona):
- **Cannot transfer** - European event is produced by a different show organizer
- Can only transfer to other TechCon events (same organizer)
- Atlanta March 2026 dates confirmed: **March 8-12**

**Options**:
1. Attend Atlanta as planned
2. Transfer to another TechCon event (not Barcelona)
3. Forfeit registration

**New Plan**: Still considering FabCon Barcelona (October 2026) - but need separate registration
- Nandan Hegde to attend Barcelona
- Jake to join him there
- Nandan visiting UK in October as part of trip

## Original Attendees (March - decision pending)
