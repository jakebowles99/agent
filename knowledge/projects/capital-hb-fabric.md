## 2026-02-10 Handover Meeting

### Team Assignments

| Resource | Role | Delivery Model | Notes |
|----------|------|----------------|-------|
| **Saumya** | Backend data ingestion | Fixed price (~25 days) | Metadata-driven framework, reference Glass Moon for SQL ingestion |
| **Danya Kumar** | Power BI report development | TNM | Flexible for evolving requirements |
| **Nandan Hegde** | Code review (backend) | - | Also providing Fabric guidance |
| **Gagan M** | Project management | Fixed (~3-4 days) | First Fabric project |

### Technical Setup

**Service Accounts Created:**
- Admin, Dev, Prod accounts ready
- **BLOCKER**: Conditional access policies must be removed by Matt before Andy can set up Azure subscription

**Initial Tasks (Saumya):**
1. Set up Fabric capacity
2. Create workspaces
3. Implement metadata-driven framework for data pipelines
4. Reference Glass Moon project for SQL-based ingestion

**Capacity Management:**
- Azure Data Factory will manage Fabric capacity (resume/pause)
- Event-driven approach to control costs
- X Scale NOT part of implementation

### Delivery Model

- **Data Ingestion**: Fixed price (backend work)
- **Visualisation/Reporting**: TNM (client requirements evolving)
- Charge codes to be split between fixed and TNM elements

### Documentation & Tracking

- BRD is primary reference for report requirements
- Data flow references in BRD = interpret as Fabric processes
- All client changes must be documented (frequent changes expected)
- Work items tracked in client's ADO tenant

### Meeting Cadence
- Daily meetings during initial setup and data integration phase
- Will reassess after first week (potentially switch to weekly)

### Pending Actions (from Handover)
- [ ] **Nandan**: Obtain iTrent documentation from client
- [ ] **Nandan**: Coordinate with Matt re: conditional access removal
- [ ] **Andy**: Set up Azure subscription (blocked by conditional access)
- [ ] **Jake**: Clarify Power BI Pro licence availability
- [ ] **Nandan**: Provide timeline breakdown for data ingestion
- [ ] **Jake**: Clarify charge code splitting with Charlotte
- [ ] **Nandan**: Confirm ADO environment (prod vs dev)

### Client Characteristics (from Jake)
- Not data-driven organization
- CEO Harry prefers traditional methods (printed Excel spreadsheets)
- Expect frequent requirement changes - document everything
- Preference for simplicity and cost-effectiveness
