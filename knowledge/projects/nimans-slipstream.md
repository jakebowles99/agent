# Nimans Slipstream - AI Extraction Project

## Overview
AI-powered extraction system for Midwich/Nimans to process inbound emails and extract structured data for EDI integration.

## Client
- **Company**: [Midwich Group](../clients/midwich.md) (via Nimans subsidiary)
- **Primary Contact**: [Joe Thompson](../people/joe-thompson.md) - Chief Transformation Officer
- **Project Lead (Synapx)**: [Charlie Phipps-Bennett](../people/charlie-phipps-bennett.md)

## Scope (Refined Feb 6, 2026)

### Core Components
1. **Outlook Plugin Updates**
   - Database Separation & File Check - extract embedded database layer, prevent duplicate uploads
   - Company Selection Logic - dropdown for multi-entity users based on Entra ID/AD Group membership
   - SharePoint Repository Mapping - each entity maps to AD-group-controlled SharePoint library

2. **Azure AI Foundry Updates**
   - Incorporate Nimans-specific key values
   - Train on sample PDFs

3. **AI Extraction Process & Manual Review App** (NEW - Feb 6)
   - Lightweight app for viewing documents when AI cannot extract all fields
   - Review extracted fields, amend incorrect values, populate missing mandatory fields
   - Data written directly to Excel spreadsheet
   - If AI succeeds on all mandatory fields → data written straight to Excel without intervention

4. **Power Automate - CSV Generation for EDI**
   - Build flow to format CSV per Nimans' EDI specification
   - EDI API Trigger Flow - NOT in scope for this phase

5. **Testing**
   - Functional testing across all components

### USA Entity Work
