Per Matt Davies:
1. **Initial engagement**: Data platform architecture review, AI readiness recommendations
2. **Discovery outcome**: Recommended ~£50k follow-on with Fabric Capacity F64 (last call with Graeme)
3. **Underwriting discovery**: 4 workstreams reviewed (done at no cost) - SOWs written, ~£400k standalone
4. **Licensing discussion**: Power BI Pro, Fabric SKUs, Azure funding → evolved to E5 optimization
5. **Luke's vision**: Migrate 20-40 VMs to Jensten tenant (away from Razor Blue), CRM Dynamics review
6. **BPO interest**: Graeme enquired about BPO offering, wants examples

## VM Migration Notes
- VMs named after people (e.g., "Angela")
- Some on old OSs
- Henry Seymour (HS) VMs on separate domain
- Priority: Lead with data work first, then VM migration
