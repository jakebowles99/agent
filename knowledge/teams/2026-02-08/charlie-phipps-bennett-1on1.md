> Also with regards Sudarshan and Nimans, as far as I am concerned he owes me/synapx time because I let him bill to my training code. One to be aware of, so I think we should see how the project is going etc but will likely ask him to work extra to make it back

**Context:** Nimans Slipstream project - Jake notes Sudarshan billed time to Jake's training code, creating an informal "debt" to be repaid through extra work on the project. This is a staffing/resource management consideration for the Nimans work.
