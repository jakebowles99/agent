### Internal Newsletter Update Request
> **08:28 UTC** - Aishwarya Ramesh
> Hi @Andrew Price @Matt Davies @Charlie Phipps-Bennett, its has been delayed. Please do share your department updates at the earliest for the internal newsletter.

### Delivery Update (Charlie)
> **10:29 UTC** - Charlie Phipps-Bennett
> **Delivery Update**
>
> This month has been quieter on the highlights front, and it's clear we need to tighten our attention to detail and ensure our processes are being followed consistently across the board. While progress has been made on Compass, Midwich, and LCP, it's been more challenging than any of us would have liked, but the team has pushed through and kept things moving.
>
> On a brighter note, the GA release of Code Apps in Power Apps gives our App Team a fresh opportunity to learn, explore, and elevate how we approach modern app development. This is an exciting shift in the platform and something we should lean into as part of our ongoing evolution.

### Company-Wide Message Draft (Matt)
> **13:57 UTC** - Matt Davies
> might be abit blunt but if Andys ok with the wording:
>
> I can't help but feel that January has been abit like the UK weather - grey, wet and quite unforgiving! It's been a tough month across all departments (certainly Operations) and I want to speak plainly about where I think we are and where we are heading.
>
> I believe we're at a critical inflection point as a business. Many of us are feeling the strain of our push to be more mature and it's clear we're making the right moves as a business to improve. My recent visit to India highlighted just how real these challenges are for all of us across project delivery, tooling, reporting, process, new locations and more.
>
> I feel that much of our team genuinely embraces our new direction but I also need to be honest, I still feel we're holding ourselves back by not collectively pulling in the same direction. This year we will move faster than we ever have and develop at a speed that will stretch us. That is exciting but it also needs all of us to be aligned on the company vision and support each other in the day to day. Sick leave is really hurting us, particularly in India. Its causing measurable impact to our projects and our clients and its now, sadly, something that we actively have to plan for and come to expect. I ask that each of us really thinks about the impact of all of our actions (I am trying to do this constantly too) whether this is submitting a timesheet late, not being thorough enough with testing, not communicating properly or taking last minute leave before a project go-live. If we all are more conscious of this I feel we will collectively begin to improve. We have a lot to look forward to and there is so much opportunity for us to develop and grow but only when we all feel the pain and benefit of pulling in the same direction. February (I hope) will bring some brighter days, especially as most of us are all settling into our new offices and we adapt to our new ways of working.

> **13:58 UTC** - Andrew Price
