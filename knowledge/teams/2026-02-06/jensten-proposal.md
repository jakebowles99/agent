## Key Messages

### Engagement Timeline (Matt Davies)
> **11:22 UTC** - Matt Davies
> 1. engaged us initially to support with reviewing their data platform architecture and provide recommendations on how to set them up for AI future and best practice.
> 2. we performed a discovery and outcome which recommended a follow on work of c£50k with Fabric Capacity f64 (this was the last time we were on a call with Graeme)
> 3. we were then asked to perform a discovery (we did this at no cost) to perform a discovery to review a new workstream of work (4 separate areas) for Underwriting Reporting - which has now concluded and we have written the SOWs - standalone this work is c£400k.
> 4. the above naturally led to a licensing discussion, initially around power bi Pro / fabric capacity skus with Luke & available azure funding from us- and evolved to looking at the wider Microsoft license model and make recommendations for optimisation, upgrade to E5 and quotation for costs
> 5. Luke shared his vision to migrate c20-40 vms to Jensten tenant away from Razor Blue, review CRM dynamics and team integrations as well as benefit from the features of E5
> 6. Graeme separately enquired to matt about our BPO offering and wants to see some examples of what we have done elsewhere
> 7. we took the initiative to propose synapx as a service with its benefits etc
