> 2. We need history as well > We need to show / give them ability to change few columns like notes and action data / approvals / audits which are not available in stx. The app itself needs to be combination of both with additional attributes where they can edit and keep track of the orders. If requirement is only processing the new orders but once the order is placed into stx then they need to use both apps 1 for processing orders from email plugin for so / approvals for po and other for validation of orders or dashboarding / reporting of those orders. Now I think of this it should be better to have the order creation on power apps / sql / xml apis. And reviewing order / history aspect would be coming in as Fabric / Power Bi report integration with power apps. I can be wrong and might miss some of the asks or functionalities. Based on the historic data they are placing orders like validation of stocks with in last few weeks and sales aspect which will be shown when they select that product.
