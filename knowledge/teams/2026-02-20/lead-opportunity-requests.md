> Hi @Andrew, do we have any update from First Bank UK, or should I mark the opportunity as lost?

> Hi team,
> **Suggestion:** We could consider adding two additional columns in Inbound Lead report- **Website** and **Lead Rating,**
>
> Including a Website column would provide quick access to the company’s website, allowing for better insight and faster background research when reviewing leads.
>
> Adding a Lead Rating column would help us prioritise leads more effectively based on their quality and potential value.
>
> I believe these additions in PBI Report would significantly improve how we review and manage incoming leads from Website.
