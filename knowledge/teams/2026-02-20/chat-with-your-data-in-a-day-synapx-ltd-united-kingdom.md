## 10:20 - Alfredo Patallo
> Hi, I was wondering if you can provide the PDF with the labs. Thank you in advance.

## 10:29 - Tiago Canadinhas
> I assume these sessions aren't recorded, correct? Unfortunately, I missed the beginning

## 10:30 - Tatiana Hammond-Antrobus
> You are correct.

## 10:31 - Tatiana Hammond-Antrobus
> Have you managed to get into the virtual environment, Tiago?

## 10:31 - Tatiana Hammond-Antrobus
> If so, you can catch up using the notes in the Guide window.

## 10:31 - Tatiana Hammond-Antrobus
> If not, here's the sign-up link for the virtual environment.

## 10:32 - Tiago Canadinhas
> Thank you Tatiana!

## 10:32 - BROUMI Tarik - EIM
> Could we have the list of the prompts, so we can reproduce them easily

## 10:33 - Boris PEULIC
> They are in the guide on right side

## 10:33 - Tatiana Hammond-Antrobus
> They're not perfectly reproducible because the AI is non-deterministic, but if you follow the guide (keep scrolling) it does give suggested prompts. So far I've found my AI is far less willing to make an assertion without specific terminology from me.

## 10:36 - Orr, Jon
> Is there a way to see what the weird blank visual filters are doing?

## 10:41 - Burke, Tom
> Response as per the guide

## 10:41 - Orr, Jon
> mostly similar to you, i didn't get any clarifying questions on the new page, it just built it.
> a lot of the queries offered no "how did you get here"

## 11:39 - Oliver Ridgill
> I got it too

## 11:49 - Nuno Pissarra
> Is there a way to test a sequence of questions? Or do we need to do it one by one?

## 11:57 - Tatiana Hammond-Antrobus
> Just on lunch, what time should we come back to start the second session?

## 11:57 - Tatiana Hammond-Antrobus
> Thanks.

## 13:41 - Tatiana Hammond-Antrobus
> I got this:
>
> The best-selling product by total sales value is the Air cushion machine (Blue), with $6,494,580 in sales and 3,420 units sold. This product generated a profit of $2,595,780.
>
> By units sold, the top product is Black and orange fragile despatch tape 48mmx75m, with 130,824 units sold, total sales of $484,049, and a total profit of $248,565.60.
>
> Please specify if you are interested in best-selling by sales value or by units sold for future queries.

## 13:41 - Tatiana Hammond-Antrobus
> Seems alright. It did specify both.

## 13:44 - Eloi Perez Aguilar
> Both of them worked for me

## 13:47 - Tatiana Hammond-Antrobus
> Utterly bizarre uppercase/lowercase phenomenon you're seeing. In my case, I told my AI to always reiterate definitions to end-user, and here's the exchange that followed:
>
> I asked it: What's our best-selling product? (not the lowercase b)
>
> It answered: The best-selling product is defined as the one with the most units sold. According to the available data, the best-selling product is "Black and orange fragile despatch tape 48mmx75m" with a total of 130,824 units sold between 2019 and 2026.
>
> - Best-selling = most units sold
> - Highest selling = total sales value

## 13:54 - Burke, Tom
> I think there is a MCP server that allows you to edit the TMDL file through AI in vscode.

## 13:57 - Anthony Soen
> sorry bout that
