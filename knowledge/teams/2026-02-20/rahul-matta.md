Do you think of any more fixes
I'm thinking of saving justification generation into the claim document in Cosmos alongside signals/rules/score cause currently we are not storing it (it was there as part of previous edit functionality) and every time a claim is viewed it calls GPT-4 all over again.

> Hi Jake,
Just a quick update, I have reviewed and merged the PR after testing locally.
I also resolved the GitHub Actions workflow issue, and deployments are now running correctly for both frontend and backend for every push.
Since Navsheen is out today, please let me know if there’s anything you’d like me to pick up.
