> <p>We have the ISV call tomm. I want that to be for fraud prediction ai agent related.</p>
<p>I think we are faster to push that on marketplace than doc extraction. Fraud prediction will be pitched to jenston as well so would be nice if we're able to find a way to charge them through marketplace directly.&nbsp;</p>
