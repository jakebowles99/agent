> <p>Morning <at id="0">Everyone</at>, the deck appears to have stalled (assuming the link above is still the most relevant one) and it's still a long way from being ready. The journey still feels fragmented to me and there is still no commercial proposition or transition into Synapx as a Service. are we dependent on anyone/anything else than ourselves at this stage? </p>

## 22:09 - Matt Davies

## 22:05 - Matt Davies
> <p>slide 4 - we could couple the underwriting work underneath the Fabric foundation to show that they are linked</p>

## 22:03 - Matt Davies
> <p>deck much improved thanks Sophia. the "journey" we have been on with them ends at slide 10 and that is where we should transition into our wider proposal and recommendations </p>
