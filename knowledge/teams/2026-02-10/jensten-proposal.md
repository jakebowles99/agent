# Teams Chat — Jensten Proposal

## 05:19 - Matt Davies
> <p>Morning <at id="0">Everyone</at>, the deck appears to have stalled (assuming the link above is still the most relevant one) and it's still a long way from being ready. The journey still feels fragmented to me and there is still no commercial proposition or transition into Synapx as a Service. are we dependent on anyone/anything else than ourselves at this stage? </p>
