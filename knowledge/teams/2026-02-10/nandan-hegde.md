> B) We said we'd increase the estimates

## 16:42 - Jake Bowles
> Bearing in mind we A) have gone over on every LCP project so far

## 16:38 - Nandan Hegde
> sure, if the LCP team dont have an issue but 2 days (16 hrs) ismore than swhat would be needed .
> 
> 1 day would be sufficient

## 16:37 - Jake Bowles
> More the better 🙂

## 16:37 - Nandan Hegde
> werent we planning ANand for Midwich?

## 16:37 - Jake Bowles
> My thinking is that Anand is just around the corner and would be useful

## 16:36 - Nandan Hegde
> would be my thgt

## 16:36 - Nandan Hegde
