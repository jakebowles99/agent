> As mentioned earlier, I need the list of activities, the planned effort for each, and the start and end dates along with any dependencies, Any Risk. If this information is provided in Excel, I can quickly create a Gantt chart and present the task breakdown. Once I receive all the necessary details, I will need at least 2-3 hours to complete the work. However, creating this on DevOps will require additional time 3-4hrs
