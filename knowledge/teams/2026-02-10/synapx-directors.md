## 20:59 - [Charlie Phipps-Bennett] > Spoke to Narayan about Customer Service install internally. He can set it up with me over a weekend February 21st and 22nd.

He would need Azure Subscription to setup Azure B2C. Power Platform and Dynamics Administrator and he will then configure:

Self service
Retrieval of tickets
Portal
Teams Integration

He can then hand over to someone our side to do any portal customisations we want like logos etc...

Thoughts?
## 18:56 - [Charlie Phipps-Bennett] > Another Power App cool change/release today that I have shared with the team. I am speaking with Ajay on Wednesday because he needs to:

1) Show more senior behaviour, only get an update when prompted. Lack of communication is poor.

2) Development approach and approach to new ways of working. Challenged him in Christmas need to see more from him.

3) His comment the morning on timesheet notes quite frankly pissed me off. It is a 2min job, glad Matt shut that down.

4) Since being an MVP, I have not seen him push one update to the company about new releases, upcoming features, preview features, latest and greatest. Bugger all I have seen.

Going to explain I want more from him in order for him to grow. I think some of his work is top class but other attributes are letting him down

## 18:19 - [Charlie Phipps-Bennett] > Looks like we are re-inventing the wheel. I have learnt from V-Align about SalesIQ which is an out-of-box agent we can configure into Zoho with Native API Integration with Whatsapp.

Sounds like a more viable solution for customer. Getting a demo internally next week and then will arrange external client facing demo.
