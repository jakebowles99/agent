## 10:27 - Charlie Phipps-Bennett
> I am happy to manage Nimens whilst you focus on Midwich Limited.

> Nimens is very small scope

## 10:24 - Andrew Price
> Given you are there this week, think it is unnecessary, but I am not close enough to the project and I will let Charlie decide

## 10:22 - Yaz Qaraqesh
> Gents can any of you get back to me on the above question please - if you'd like me to join I need to pencil that in my calendar
