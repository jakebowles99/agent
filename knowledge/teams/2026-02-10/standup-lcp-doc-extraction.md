> <p><at id="0">Ajay</at>&nbsp;I want to update LCP ADO with the tickets retrospectively but my password had expired so i created a new one. However its now saying that sign in failed due to change in email or password. Tarun has suggested that the lanware IT team needs to manually allow me to sign in again. Is that what it is?</p>

> However, when the email body + PDF are provided together, extraction completes, but the values are picked only from the PDF, not from the email body.
