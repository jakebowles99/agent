# Teams Chat — BES Group - Synapx - Venture

## 20:33 - Jake Bowles
> Hi Josh, sounds good. Andy and I are onsite with a customer all day on the 25th so I don't think we'll be able to commit to that time until the day. Alternatively, I can work with all other days that week

## 20:30 - Andrew Price
> Hi Josh

## 20:27 - Josh de la Harpe
> Hi both, thanks again for today, genuinely went a long way. We caught up with BES later and they seem bought into us as a collective, which is great.
> 
> Quick update on funding, we’ve spoken to Microsoft and we’re in a strong position. Nothing confirmed until scope’s finalised, but it’s been floated internally as likely approval. We’re drafting the first SoW (using a template from MS) with the aim of getting it agreed next week so MS can submit for funding - they’ve said roughly 2 weeks turnaround.
> 
> CMF kickoff is pencilled for Wed 25th, likely 10:30am (TBC). Would one of you be able to join just to listen in so we’re fully aligned before it hands back to us?
> 
> Any questions give me a shout and happy to help.
