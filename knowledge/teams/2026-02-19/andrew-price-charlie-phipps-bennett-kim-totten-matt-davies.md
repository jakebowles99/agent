> I said kiss but if you want to snog then be my guess

## 16:32 - Kim Totten
> Here's me thinking i'm doing a good job getting in the same room and you want me to snog Satya 😄

## 16:32 - Charlie Phipps-Bennett
> If not I will make that happen with Sonnett 😉

## 16:31 - Charlie Phipps-Bennett
> If you do get a photo opportunity as the picture is being taken can you kiss him or something. Help us go viral

## 16:30 - Kim Totten
> i know they usually rush him through things, but I've met him before in 2017, he did a press release for a small number of partners in London when he released his hit refresh book

## 16:28 - Charlie Phipps-Bennett
> You wouldn't get near him, have you seen his bodyguards?

## 16:27 - Kim Totten
> I doubt Satya will hang around but it would be cool to get a picture for LinkedIn 😄

## 16:26 - Kim Totten
> I will be around most of the day on Tuesday - I have the breakfast lounge with the execs and (potentially Satya) and a couple of meetings throughout the day but will make time for a catch up with them

## 16:25 - Kim Totten
> of course

## 16:25 - Charlie Phipps-Bennett
> Excellent, a key client and we are pitching Synapx as a service to them. Really think it would benefit you grabbing 5mins with them and explaining what you do

## 16:24 - Kim Totten
> sent them screenshots of what to do and let them know to call me via teams if they need help and I will be available

## 16:18 - Charlie Phipps-Bennett
> Thank you

## 16:18 - Kim Totten

## 16:17 - Kim Totten
