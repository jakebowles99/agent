> the reason i want to add in review is that when a claim is being investigated by an analyst then another analyst should be able to see so that they dont pick up the same claim which is already being worked at by someone else. hope that makes sense.

**Context:** This relates to the LCP Document Extraction product. Navsheen is clarifying the claim review workflow states to Rahul:
- `Needs Review` - claim awaiting analyst attention
- `In Review` (NEW) - claim being actively worked by an analyst (prevents duplicate work)
- `Approved` / `Rejected` - final states

The "In Review" status is being added to prevent multiple analysts picking up the same claim simultaneously.
