> Looks like we are re-inventing the wheel. I have learnt from V-Align about SalesIQ which is an out-of-box agent we can configure into Zoho with Native API Integration with Whatsapp.
>
> Sounds like a more viable solution for customer. Getting a demo internally next week and then will arrange external client facing demo.

> @Jake Bowles unless you have an interest I am happy to manage this one solo ?

## 18:26 - Jake Bowles
> All yours

> hang on if it's the same sales IQ we are using then I would suggest otherwise because it didn't work out for us and @Matt can explain further why but before presenting that as a solution to compass i suggest we align first if that's a viable solution or not please

## 18:36 - Charlie Phipps-Bennett
> I will wait for internal demo. Then know my options on how to proceed


## 18:46 - Matt Davies
> sending Pro on Adobe @Charlie Phipps-Bennett but dont sign until we are happy with Narayans response please

> Another Power App cool change/release today that I have shared with the team. I am speaking with Ajay on Wednesday because he needs to:
>
> 1) Show more senior behaviour, only get an update when prompted. Lack of communication is poor.
>
> 2) Development approach and approach to new ways of working. Challenged him in Christmas need to see more from him.
>
> 3) His comment the morning on timesheet notes quite frankly pissed me off. It is a 2min job, glad Matt shut that down.
>
> 4) Since being an MVP, I have not seen him push one update to the company about new releases, upcoming features, preview features, latest and greatest. Bugger all I have seen.
>
> Going to explain I want more from him in order for him to grow. I think some of his work is top class but other attributes are letting him down
