> Looks like we are re-inventing the wheel. I have learnt from V-Align about SalesIQ which is an out-of-box agent we can configure into Zoho with Native API Integration with Whatsapp.

> Sounds like a more viable solution for customer. Getting a demo internally next week and then will arrange external client facing demo.

> hang on if it's the same sales IQ we are using then I would suggest otherwise because it didn't work out for us and @Matt can explain further why but before presenting that as a solution to compass i suggest we align first if that's a viable solution or not please

> I will wait for internal demo. Then know my options on how to proceed
