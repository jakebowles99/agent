> So you ask us for costs then tell us your budget, bellends!

## 15:09 - Charlie Phipps-Bennett
> I guess the ask is now what can they achieve with 40k budget?

## 15:10 - Charlie Phipps-Bennett
> Phase 0 is 20k so that leaves 20k budget. Liv-ex and Bordeaux City Bond API Integrations is not possible with 20k budget.

> @Jake @Bowles what ideas do you have?

## 15:12 - Jake Bowles
> Choose 1 API?

## 15:13 - Charlie Phipps-Bennett
> I would say only Liv-ex in this because we know that is possible?

## 15:13 - Jake Bowles
> Well, we know it exists

## 15:13 - Jake Bowles
> Haven't done anything yet

## 15:13 - Charlie Phipps-Bennett
> Push them to 50k budget and say we can do Liv-ex but Bordeaux has to wait...
