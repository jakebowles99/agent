## 06:40 - Navsheen Koul
> Not ideal but less on priority than the extraction bit in itself

## 06:41 - Navsheen Koul
> Work with the email pdf only, it's straight forward than the long pdfs and is in hierarchy too

## 06:42 - Navsheen Koul
> If we can't pull out from the emails correctly, OCs are illogical to go after

## 06:45 - Navsheen Koul
> FYI @Jake @Charlie vijay is handing over to Katayani today as he is required on midwich

**Context:** Pre-demo status check for the LCP Document Extraction project. Demo scheduled today at 13:30 UTC (Outlook Plugin + Fraud Prediction Demo with Tayo Eletu-Odibo from Leadenhall).

**Issues:**
- AI extraction not getting expected outcomes with different analysers - Ajay still working on it
- Website and plugin have no bugs except for the extraction issue
- Email PDF extraction is the priority - Navsheen says OCs are illogical to pursue until email extraction works

**Resource Change:**
- **Vijay G** handing over to **Katyayani Lal** today - Vijay required on Midwich project
- Jake and Charlie tagged for awareness
- **Handover in progress:** Katyayani requesting plugin access from Ajay; Navsheen shared field descriptions file
