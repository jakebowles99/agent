### Code Review Clarification (05:57)
**Nandan Hegde** (responding to Charlie's Feb 6 message about code reviews):
> "Are you talking about this scope? Because this was more on data entry aspect over code scope. Code reviews are being done on any PRs now from Dev to QA and above"

## Context
Charlie (Feb 6) requested code reviews be scheduled before UAT:
- **Apps reviews**: Ajay, Akshansh, or Charlie
- **Data reviews**: Jake or Nandan

Nandan clarified his previous comment was about data entry scope, not code scope. Code reviews already happening on PRs from Dev to QA environments.

## Process Established
- Code reviews required before UAT deployment
- Reviewers should be scheduled in advance or have calendar placeholders
