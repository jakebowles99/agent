> Hi Jake Bowles, Good evening.
> 
> - Completed the Word template setup with all required content controls (company details plus Background, Scope, Deliverables, Out of Scope, Rate Card, Fees & Agreement) so Logic Apps can populate every section dynamically.
> - Updated and aligned the HTTP trigger schema and OpenAPI `SOWInput` model to support all SOW fields and multiple uploaded files, and started wiring those fields into the Logic App’s “Populate a Microsoft Word template” action for end‑to‑end SOW generation.
