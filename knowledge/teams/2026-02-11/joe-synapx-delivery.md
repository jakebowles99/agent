## 20:12 - Jake Bowles
> Hi Charlie Phipps-Bennett, Joe is looking to integrate the work that has been done on the bids app (by MW) with our Foundry (with the analyzer I have deployed) - Do you have any time tomorrow to advise on next steps and what that looks like? It will be similar/the same as the PO app.
