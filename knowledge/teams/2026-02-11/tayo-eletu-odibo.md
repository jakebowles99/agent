> Hi Tayo, saw your email. Nandan is travelling home at the moment so will respond when he's back (1hr or so) but in summary we have not hooked up the mailbox to fabric yet so that may explain why there is nothing there for today. I could be wrong but that is what I suspect

> In regards the other CIT, I will have that SOW with you today
