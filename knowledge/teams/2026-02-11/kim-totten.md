## 14:12 - Kim Totten
> Yes but as we mentioned last month the feedback hasn't been great unfortunately, so I think the plan was to start to build out from scratch a standard set out by UK and then slowly progress resource onto delivery through shadowing best practice - something we can chat about how best to do that

## 14:09 - Jake Bowles
> Saumya has done them before so we're covered

## 14:08 - Kim Totten
> for future sessions we should have a scheduled person in to learn so we can start skilling the team, otherwise we are at risk of running into problems should Nandan not be able to deliver on the day

## 14:05 - Jake Bowles
> Don't think so, no

## 14:04 - Kim Totten
> ok, does he have a shadow or someone to attend alongside to learn

## 14:03 - Jake Bowles
> Nandan

## 14:03 - Kim Totten
> Hey - Just confirming whether you or Nandan are delivering Fridays Fabric in a day workshop?

## 14:44 - Jake Bowles
> Sorry on a train atm hence the fragmented messages - Yes, agree it's a fundamental issue and biting me in a lot of other elements too

## 14:40 - Kim Totten
> is there any kind of training in place at the moment to improve those skills within the team

## 14:40 - Kim Totten
> well that's a bigger issue we need to address asap

## 14:39 - Jake Bowles
> It's basic consultancy skills that people lack and I don't think shadowing a few sessions will help that

## 14:39 - Kim Totten
> whether that is personal development feedback or material feedback

## 14:39 - Kim Totten
> So we need to set an example, maybe even get them to deliver a dry run to us internally so we can critique and put steps in place to make it better

## 14:38 - Jake Bowles
> I can't imagine Nandan will be much better

## 14:38 - Jake Bowles
> No my point was that if Saumya got shit feedback we'll get shit feedback from everyone else too

## 14:36 - Kim Totten
> Charlie is on board to do the same from his teams perspective

## 14:35 - Kim Totten
> I don't care who does it to be honest, as long as it's done well and we are all clear on how it is repeated as an initiative internally, It's more just about setting the standard from a leadership perspective so that the message will then cascade down the teams as we onboard more team members to run them (and to also promote that these aren't really optional in terms of people opting out, it's part of our core offering). Whether that is you and Nandan working together to share that message and deliver the dry runs internally to the team, you can work that out between you both but the message and initiative should come from the top of the team, which is why I have come to you about it
