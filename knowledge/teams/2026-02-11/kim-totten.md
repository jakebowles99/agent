## 14:12 - Kim Totten
> Yes but as we mentioned last month the feedback hasn't been great unfortunately, so I think the plan was to start to build out from scratch a standard set out by UK and then slowly progress resource onto delivery through shadowing best practice - something we can chat about how best to do that

## 14:09 - Jake Bowles
> Saumya has done them before so we're covered

## 14:08 - Kim Totten
> for future sessions we should have a scheduled person in to learn so we can start skilling the team, otherwise we are at risk of running into problems should Nandan not be able to deliver on the day

## 14:05 - Jake Bowles
> Don't think so, no

## 14:04 - Kim Totten
> ok, does he have a shadow or someone to attend alongside to learn

## 14:03 - Jake Bowles
> Nandan

## 14:03 - Kim Totten
> Hey - Just confirming whether you or Nandan are delivering Fridays Fabric in a day workshop?
