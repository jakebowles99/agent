## 08:08 - Tushara Udata > @Synapx | Everyone Today is Friday, and all timesheets for this week must be submitted by COB. If your entries are still pending or incomplete, please update as soon as possible!

We will be reviewing submissions, and anyone with pending or incomplete timesheets will be followed up directly with necessary actions.

If you’re facing any issues, message me right away.
Thanks & Happy Weekend! 🙂

## 15:41 - Matt Davies > Hi @Synapx | Everyone - from today onwards please ensure you are adding notes to all of your entries in Harvest.  This visibility is very important to us and any entries with no notes added can be rejected by the PM.

Any Q's please let me know, thanks
