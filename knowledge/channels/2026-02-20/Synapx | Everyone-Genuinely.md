## 20:18 - [Fraser Hamilton] > Our **NordVPN** subscription ends this Sunday (*22 February*) and will be replaced with **Azure VPN Client** 🎉 which will deploy to all devices from Intune automatically soon.

In this transition we will lose* access to the NordVPN dedicated IP address (**212.237.225.22**) and we need to advise clients of our new external IP address from Azure (**51.142.25.0/30**).

Please can you reply here or message me directly with any clients that we use NordVPN to access their environment, as we will need to contact them to update their firewall / access policies with the new IP address.

The following people have accessed NordVPN in the previous year, so your assistance is appreciated!

@Ajay Gannamaneni, @Akshansh Sharma, @Charlie Phipps-Bennett, @Divya Sharma, @Hemanth Kotha, @Kushagra Shukla, @Matt Davies, @Saumya Dubey, @Tarun Reddy, @Timon Wan, @Vaishnavi MP, @Vijay G
