## 08:04 - [Tushara Udata] > Timesheets Submission Reminder - Action Required Today
Friendly reminder that all timesheets must be submitted by COB today. No notes = No approval.

Noticed that several of you haven't even started logging this week’s hours. Please do, as we will review submissions by COB today for any defaulters, with respective actions where required.

Thanks in advance, Happy Weekend!

## 20:18 - [Fraser Hamilton] > Nord VPN retirement / Azure VPN replacement!
Our NordVPN subscription ends this Sunday (22 February) and will be replaced with Azure VPN Client which will deploy to all devices from Intune automatically soon.

In this transition we will lose access to the NordVPN dedicated IP address (212.237.225.22) and we need to advise clients of our new external IP address from Azure (51.142.25.0/30).

Please reply here or message me directly with any clients that we use NordVPN to access their environment, as we will need to contact them to update their firewall / access policies with the new IP address.
